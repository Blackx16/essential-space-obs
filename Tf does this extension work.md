 ==**`sync mathakoot counter = 6`**==
 
 I thought it had something to do with sync but once first vault got synced it is working fine I don't know how it worked 
 
 my stupid aah thought that you had to sync twice without making changes and then make a change , but this extension has a mind of its own

## Some Guidelines:

- So if you want to change a file name do not do it with the file content changes. Do the changes in the contents of the file, sync and then and only then are supposed to change the filename. Also after changing the filename immediately sync.

- Before installation make sure the directory is ***absolutely empty.***

- Also DO NOT MESS WITH `.obsidian` FOLDER.

- Pray TO GOD IT WORKS THIS SYNC
